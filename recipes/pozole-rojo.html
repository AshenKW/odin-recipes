    <h1>Steps:</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place pork shoulder, pork loin, and pork neck bones in a large pot;
        cover with water. Add 1 head of garlic and salt to taste. Bring to a
        boil, reduce heat and simmer until meat is tender and cooked through,
        about 1 hour. Stir in hominy; bring to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place tomato and guajillo chiles in a pot and add enough
        water to cover; bring to a boil. Cook until chiles have softened, about
        15 minutes; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place tomato and chiles with salt, 1 clove garlic, oregano, and cumin in
        a blender; add 2 cups water. Blend until smooth. Strain mixture through
        a fine-mesh sieve and set chile sauce aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer pork to a work surface and shred with 2 forks. Discard the pork
        bones and garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir chile sauce and shredded pork into the pot. Simmer pozole until
        flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle pozole into serving bowls and top with shredded cabbage and onion;
        serve lime wedge on the side.
      </li>
    </ol>
